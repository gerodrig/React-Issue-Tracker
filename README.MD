# ReactQuery Issues Project

This project is a basic example on how to use ReactQuery, also known as Tanstack Query, in a React application.

<br /> 
<br /> 

The project is a web-based application built using React and React Query. The application utilizes the GitHub API to fetch open and closed issues for various projects. The main focus of this project was to create an efficient way of retrieving and displaying the issues. React Query was used to handle the API calls, ensuring that the data is efficiently fetched, cached and updated. The user interface was designed to showcase the issues in a clear and organized manner, making it easy for users to navigate and find the information they need. The implementation of infinite scrolling allows for seamless navigation through the issues, making it possible for users to view a large number of issues without having to constantly refresh the page. Overall, this project provides an excellent solution for anyone looking to view and track issues in their favorite GitHub projects.
